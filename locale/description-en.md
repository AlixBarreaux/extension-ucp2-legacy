# UCP2 Legacy
This extension can be used to recreate the UCP2 features you may be already used to.

Almost every feature that was released in UCP2 has been ported to this new modding framework.

Check out the Releases at the UCP2 GitHub repo for an overview of the features.

## Usage
When you activate this extension, every feature will be off by default. 
If you want to use the default settings that came with UCP2, use the UCP2 legacy defaults extension!
This extension will then be activated as a dependency.
